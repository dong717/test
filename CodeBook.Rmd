## Variables 
subject: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
activity: Their activity name.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ  
tGravityAcc-XYZ  
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
tBodyGyro-XYZ  
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ  
tBodyAccMag  
tGravityAccMag  
tBodyAccJerkMag  
tBodyGyroMag

fBodyAcc-XYZ  
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
fBodyGyro-XYZ  
fBodyAccMag  
fBodyAccJerkMag  
fBodyGyroMag  
fBodyGyroJerkMag  

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:   

mean(): the average of each variable mean value for each subject and each activity.  
std(): the average of each variable standard deviation for each subject and each activity.
